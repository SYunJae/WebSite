            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p><b><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html50/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HyperText Markup Language</a></b>, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to <u>create web pages</u>. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[1] Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.
            </p>
            <p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
            </p>
            <p>The language is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets . Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
